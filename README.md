# **Project Overview**

## **Business Case**

#### For many years, Rockbuster Stealth LLC was the biggest movie rental company in the market with presence all around the world, but that quickly changed with the development and increased popularity of the internet. The competition (like Netflix and Amazon) was disruptive, transforming the traditional operations of having stock distributed along the stores, to operate in a virtual space with virtual inventory--in consequence, the operations costs downsized and the revenue increased.

#### The traditional business model led by Rockbuster fell behind as the new business model:
- Made content accessible for a broader population size
- Changed the product consumption by selling subscriptions that granted access to the whole content, rather than renting films


## **Area of Opportunity & Goal**

#### *Renew or Die: The Importance of Change*

#### Why was important to acknowledge Rockbuster's market disadvantage and take action on it?
#### **To survive the onslaught of the new streaming companies and become competitive again**. In that sense, Rockbuster had to strategize and adapt to the current market dynamics; the effort was led by the Business Intelligence (BI) department, analyizing how to exploit the movies licenses Rockbuster already had, and **creating a new online video service**.


## **Objectives, Scope & Deliverables**

#### Rockbuster's goal is to open an online video rental service (not streaming), but is this the right way? 

#### To set the strategy, the following business questions were posed:
- *Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?*
- *What was the average rental duration for all videos?*
- *Which countries are Rochbuster customers based in?*
- *Where are customers with high lifetime value based?*
- *Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?*

#### The project's scope is answering the business questions above by quering the necessary data from Rockbuster's database using SQL. This database contains information on customers, inventory, rentals, payments, stores, staff, among other relevant/related information. 

#### Aside the expected data-driven answers the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board needed to set the strategy, some visualizations were delivered to make the information digestable and easy to interpret. Follow the Tableau Public links listed below to see the visualizations made to answer the project's objectives.

#### ***Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?***

#### This visualization show the [Top 10 movies that contributed the most to revenue and the ratings they belong to](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.aroche/viz/RockbusterTop10FilmswithLowestRevenue/Sheet1?publish=yes).

#### This visualization show the [10 movies with the lowest revenue and the ratings they belong to](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.aroche/viz/RockbusterTop10FilmswithLowestRevenue/Sheet1?publish=yes).

#### This visualization show the [proportion of film revenue aggregate by category](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.aroche/viz/FilmRevenueAggregateProportionbyCategory/Sheet1?publish=yes).

#### To be even more specific, a visualization to show the [film amount and made revenue proportion by category](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.aroche/viz/RockerbusterFilmAmountRevenueProportionbyRating/Sheet1?publish=yes) was created.

#### ***What was the average rental duration for all videos?***

#### This visualization shows the [average rental duration by category](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.aroche/viz/RockbusterAverageRentalDuration/Sheet1?publish=yes).

#### ***Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?***, ***Where are customers with high lifetime value based?***, ***Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?***

#### A [map](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.aroche/viz/CustomerBaseSizePaymentsConcentrationbyCountry/Sheet1?publish=yes) was created to answer geographic locations and size of customers base, and revenue size by regions.


#### Finally, you will be able to find the queries made to answer the objectives of this project in the repository's files.
